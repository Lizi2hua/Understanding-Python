1.class means bundling data and functionality together.
class数据和函数的集合
2.Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state.
Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
每个类的实例都由属性维护整个类的实例的状态，每个实例化的类通过方法来修改它的状态
3.Python have all the OPP features:
                                  1:inheritance mechanism:a derived class can override any methods of its base class
                                                          or classes.can also call the same method name of its base class
                                                          or classes.
                                  2.Object can contain arbitrary(任意的）amount and all kinds of data,and can be modified
                                    further after creation.
4.namespace is a mapping from name and objects,and it currently implemented as Python dictionary.
命名空间是名字和对象的映射，通过python的字典实现。
5.Class objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation
类支持两种操作：属性引用和实例化
